          <h2>Welcome to the Natural Park</h2><hr>
          <p>The Los Andes Natural Park, a biosphere reserve, is an obligatory reference point for the inland Mediterranean forest and scrub, and habitat for native fauna and flora.</p>
          </p><p> It was declared a natural park in 1983, with an area of 9,090 hectares. being one of the largest enclaves in the Valencian Community. With a great thickness of vegetation, and several streams offer an ideal climate for terrestrial and aquatic species. Its forests, holm oak and pine, are home to a large colony of birds.<p>
           Among the species in the park we can highlight one of the last colonies of griffon vultures in the area. We will also be constantly flown over by the peregrine falcon or the Bonelli's eagle. As we approach the streams, we will see numerous footsteps of wild boar and deer, and if we do not make too much noise, it is not difficult to find some drinking under the watchful eye of the kingfisher, waiting for the absent-minded trout.</p>
